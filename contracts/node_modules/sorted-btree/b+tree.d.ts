/**
 * A reasonably fast collection of key-value pairs with a powerful API.
 * Largely compatible with the standard Map. BTree is a B+ tree data structure,
 * so the collection is sorted by key.
 *
 * B+ trees tend to use memory more efficiently than hashtables such as the
 * standard Map, especially when the collection contains a large number of
 * items. However, maintaining the sort order makes them modestly slower:
 * O(log size) rather than O(1). This B+ tree implementation supports O(1)
 * fast cloning. It also supports freeze(), which can be used to ensure that
 * a BTree is not changed accidentally.
 *
 * Confusingly, the ES6 Map.forEach(c) method calls c(value,key) instead of
 * c(key,value), in contrast to other methods such as set() and entries()
 * which put the key first. I can only assume that the order was reversed on
 * the theory that users would usually want to examine values and ignore keys.
 * BTree's forEach() therefore works the same way, but a second method
 * `.forEachPair((key,value)=>{...})` is provided which sends you the key
 * first and the value second; this method is slightly faster because it is
 * the "native" for-each method for this class.
 *
 * Out of the box, BTree supports keys that are numbers, strings, arrays of
 * numbers/strings, Date, and objects that have a valueOf() method returning a
 * number or string. Other data types, such as arrays of Date or custom
 * objects, require a custom comparator, which you must pass as the second
 * argument to the constructor (the first argument is an optional list of
 * initial items). Symbols cannot be used as keys because they are unordered
 * (one Symbol is never "greater" or "less" than another).
 *
 * @example
 * Given a {name: string, age: number} object, you can create a tree sorted by
 * name and then by age like this:
 *
 *     var tree = new BTree(undefined, (a, b) => {
 *       if (a.name > b.name)
 *         return 1; // Return a number >0 when a > b
 *       else if (a.name < b.name)
 *         return -1; // Return a number <0 when a < b
 *       else // names are equal (or incomparable)
 *         return a.age - b.age; // Return >0 when a.age > b.age
 *     });
 *
 *     tree.set({name:"Bill", age:17}, "happy");
 *     tree.set({name:"Fran", age:40}, "busy & stressed");
 *     tree.set({name:"Bill", age:55}, "recently laid off");
 *     tree.forEachPair((k, v) => {
 *       console.log(`Name: ${k.name} Age: ${k.age} Status: ${v}`);
 *     });
 *
 * @description
 * The "range" methods (`forEach, forRange, editRange`) will return the number
 * of elements that were scanned. In addition, the callback can return {break:R}
 * to stop early and return R from the outer function.
